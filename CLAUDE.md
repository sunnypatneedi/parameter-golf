# CLAUDE.md — Parameter Golf AI Agent Instructions

---

## TL;DR

**Parameter Golf**: Train the best language model that fits in a 16MB artifact and trains in under 10 minutes on 8xH100 SXM GPUs, scored by compression quality (bits-per-byte) on FineWeb validation.

**Challenge**: https://github.com/openai/parameter-golf | https://openai.com/index/parameter-golf/

**Core Delivery**: Lowest val_bpb score | 16MB artifact constraint | 10-min train budget | 10-min eval budget | Tokenizer-agnostic BPB metric

**NOT**: A general LLM training framework | A production inference system | A data engineering project. This is a constrained optimization competition — every decision optimizes for val_bpb within the 16MB/10-min constraints.

**Stack**: Python 3 + PyTorch (CUDA/H100) + MLX (Apple Silicon local dev) + SentencePiece + zstd/zlib compression

**Repo**: Single-repo with baseline scripts at root and competition submissions in `records/`

---

## Critical Rules

1. **16MB artifact limit**: code (`train_gpt.py`) + compressed model weights must be < 16,000,000 bytes (decimal, not MiB). Check artifact size on EVERY experiment.
2. **No network during eval**: The artifact must be fully self-contained. No downloads, no API calls during evaluation.
3. **Validation data is sacred**: NEVER access validation data during training. Test-time training is ONLY allowed on validation tokens already evaluated (already graded).
4. **train_gpt.py is the submission**: All counted code lives in this single file. Submissions are self-contained folders in `records/`.
5. **Don't edit baseline scripts for competition work**: `train_gpt.py` (root) and `train_gpt_mlx.py` are onboarding scripts. Competition work goes in `records/` folders.
6. **Statistical significance required**: New SOTA must beat existing by >=0.005 nats with p<0.01 across 3 seeds.
7. **MLX is for learning, not tuning**: MLX and CUDA have different numerical paths (float32 vs bf16 Muon). Never trust absolute bpb numbers from MLX runs.
8. **Always run the quantization roundtrip**: Post-quant val_bpb is the submission score, not pre-quant.
9. **Shut down RunPod pods when idle** — $3+/hr adds up fast.
10. Plan before building — non-trivial changes get a written hypothesis first.

## Security & Safety

### Destructive Operations

**PROHIBITED without explicit user confirmation**:
- **RunPod**: Deleting pods with unsaved work, terminating running experiments
- **Git**: push --force, reset --hard, deleting branches with experiment results
- **Data**: Deleting downloaded dataset shards (16GB+ redownload)

### Agent Boundaries

**NEVER autonomously**: spend RunPod credits (always confirm before launching pods) | modify the root `train_gpt.py` or `train_gpt_mlx.py` for competition purposes | submit PRs to the upstream repo | delete experiment logs

**ALWAYS**: track experiment results with hypothesis and verdict | verify artifact size < 16,000,000 bytes | run 3 seeds before claiming a result | check competition rules before novel eval approaches

## Competition Strategy

**Merged leaderboard SOTA**: 1.1194 val_bpb (abaybektursun, PR #549, 2026-03-23)
**Best open PR (unmerged)**: 0.0804 val_bpb (PR #933 CacheMoney, n-gram phrase cache — legality debated)
**Best clearly-legal open PR**: 1.0465 val_bpb (PR #758, backward-looking 7-gram + 11L XSA-all)
**Target**: N-gram eval cache is now the meta. Pure neural submissions cannot compete. Must implement backward-looking n-gram cache.

**CRITICAL — PR #771 CLOSED (2026-03-27)**: Our submission was rejected by valerio-oai for TTT rules violation: we adapted on eval tokens then scored them (adapt-then-score = illegal). Legal TTT must adapt ONLY on already-graded tokens, then score new ones.

**The N-gram cache revolution**: Multi-order backoff (orders 2-7) + entropy-adaptive alpha blending dominates. Order-adaptive entropy gating (per-order thresholds) is the current frontier. PR #798 (0.5466 bpb) uses `ent_centers = {7: 3.0, 6: 3.2, 5: 3.5, 4: 3.8, 3: 4.2, 2: 4.5}`.

**Our next approach**:
1. **11L base** (from PR #549: LeakyReLU² + XSA-all + GradQuant int6) — strong neural foundation
2. **Backward-looking 7-gram eval cache** (PR #758 reference) — score-first, backward-looking only
3. **Entropy-adaptive alpha** mixing: `alpha = 0.05 + 0.55 * sigmoid(2 * (H - 4.0))`
4. *(Optional)* **Score-first TTT** adapting on already-graded chunks only

**Key reference PRs**: #549 (merged SOTA 1.1194), #758 (1.0465, 7-gram legal), #798 (0.5466, order-adaptive), #933 (0.0804, CacheMoney — legality unclear)

**Abandoned approaches**: LoRA TTT (hurts), AdamW TTT adapting on eval tokens (ILLEGAL — PR #771 closure), eval-time GPTQ calibration (ILLEGAL), product quantization, custom Triton kernels, DeltaNet (std=0.1724 — too unstable), two-pass eval (PR #933 approach — debated legality, risk of closure).

## Experiment Tracking

One row per run in `logs/experiments.md`:
```
Date | Exp ID | Change | val_bpb (slide) | Artifact bytes | Steps | Hypothesis → Verdict
```

Rules:
- Change ONE thing per run
- Record negative results explicitly
- 3 seeds only for submission-quality results
- Current byte headroom: ~660 KB (SOTA artifact is 15.34MB / 16.00MB with GradQuant)

## Lessons Learned

### Session 1 (2026-03-22)
1. **Ship experiments first, debate strategy second.** Time-box planning to 30 min. Run a GPU experiment in the first hour, not the fifth.
2. **Always use `nohup` for RunPod commands.** SSH drops on 15-min runs. Pattern: `nohup bash -c 'CMD > /workspace/run.log 2>&1' &`
3. **Never launch parallel torchrun on the same pod.** Two jobs on 8xH100 corrupt each other. Run sequentially.
4. **1xH100 cannot run SOTA-class models.** Only use for baseline-scale experiments or code debugging. Always use 8xH100 for SOTA work.
5. **The leaderboard moves daily.** Check BOTH merged leaderboard AND open PRs before every session.
6. **TTT gains diminish on stronger bases.** -0.075 on 1.16 base → -0.022 on 1.11 base. Always verify TTT improvement on YOUR architecture first.
7. **Stride=32 is not significant.** Tested 3 seeds: only -0.0005 nats over stride=64. Don't revisit.

### Session 2 (2026-03-23)
8. **NEVER ship unverified quantization code.** GPTQ caused 0.18 bpb quant penalty (expected 0.003). Always compare pre-quant vs post-quant bpb before adding new quant methods. Quantization bugs are silent killers.
9. **First GPU run = UNMODIFIED baseline.** Establish baseline numbers before adding ANY changes. Then add ONE change at a time. Shipping 578 new lines in one run made debugging impossible.
10. **Compute TTT time budget before setting epochs.** `epochs × batches × time/batch`. 20 epochs × 71 batches × ~1s = 1420s. Basic math catches budget blowouts.
11. **Check disk quota before downloading data.** RunPod disk quotas are per-pod, not per-filesystem. 80 shards = ~16GB. Verify space first.
12. **Depth recurrence is falsified.** PR #540 got 1.2092 bpb (worse than 1.2244 baseline). Do not attempt.

### Session 3 (2026-03-24)
13. **In-Place TTT is HARMFUL.** Loss INCREASES (2.63+, going up not down). MLP output projections are NOT good TTT targets at this scale. Do not attempt.
14. **GradQuant int5/int6 mix exceeds 16MB.** Even without int7, the artifact was 34KB over. Use uniform int6 or match PR #414's exact quantization scheme.
15. **PR #486 baseline reproduced at 1.1249** (vs reported 1.1233). Within seed variance. This is our verified baseline.
16. **The v7.0 incremental plan works.** Run 0→1→2→3 from PR #414 base. Each run adds ONE thing. Stop doing moonshots with 500+ new lines.

### Session 4 (2026-03-27/28)
17. **Adapt-then-score TTT is ILLEGAL.** PR #771 CLOSED. Multi-epoch AdamW TTT that adapts on eval tokens before scoring them = training on val set. Legal TTT must adapt ONLY on already-graded (previously-scored) chunks, then score new ones. The distinction: backward-looking = legal, adapt-then-score = illegal.
18. **N-gram eval cache is the dominant technique.** Every sub-1.10 open PR uses backward-looking n-gram cache. Pure neural or pure TTT submissions are not competitive. Multi-order backoff (2-7) + entropy-adaptive alpha is the baseline; order-adaptive entropy gating (per-order thresholds) is the frontier.
19. **DeltaNet is too unstable at this scale.** PR #1028 shows std=0.1724 across seeds (vs typical 0.001). Cannot reliably validate 3-seed claims. Do not invest GPU time until variance is solved.
20. **Organizers close PRs in batch sweeps.** 33+ PRs closed in one day (March 24-25). Submit only after carefully verifying legality against the current rule interpretation from issue #140. When in doubt, ask valerio-oai on the PR before the 3-seed run.

## Golden Rules

Every change must answer: "Does this lower val_bpb within the 16MB/10-min constraints?" If the answer is unclear, run a quick experiment on 1xH100 before investing more time. Compression and eval tricks are as valuable as architecture changes. The cheapest experiment that gives signal is the best experiment. Speed > perfection — submit early, iterate after.
